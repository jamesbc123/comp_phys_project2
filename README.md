# Computational Physics Project 2 - Eigenvector Solver

> c++ and python scripts to solve an eigenvalue problem using Jacobi's method.

> cpp_codes contains the header files and cpp files for running the scripts. The make file is also in this folder.

> py_codes contains the scripts for plotting and also a solver class similar to that performed in c++.

> the main_to_run_all_cpp_codes.py is currently not working, please use the make file in /cpp_codes and the plotting.py in /py_codes.

> all results are stored in the results folder. e.g txt, png and csv files.
